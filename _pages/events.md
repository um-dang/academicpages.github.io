## Feb 2020: Snakemake

Monday, Feb 24, 2020 \| 4-5pm \| THSL 2901

_Intro to Snakemake_

Join us as we learn about snakemake – a workflow management system used to create reproducible and scalable data analyses. We will cover an overview of the snakemake utility and the basics of the framework, create a simple example, and touch on a few key features that make snakemake an excellent choice for building workflows.

Presented by Chris Gates & Travis Saari
