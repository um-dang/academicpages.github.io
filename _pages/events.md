## Aug 2020: Intro Data Science with Python

Monday, Aug 24, 2020 \| 4-5pm \| [Virtual Meeting](https://umich.zoom.us/j/92627856500) | [Video Recording](https://youtu.be/EGqTDY0J9x4)

_A Gentle Introduction to Data Science with Python_

Python is a capable and free (open source) programming language well-suited for analysis of data, including microbiome data. Together, we will go through a real-life example, re-analyzing microbiome - immune checkpoint inhibitor studies. We will touch on both the basics (loading in data, transforming, graphing, basic statistical analysis, and outputting data and figures), and use the examples to compare and contrast with some equivalents in R. This introduction should be suitable for those with no data analysis with code experience, but have some added dimensions for those familiar with R.

## May 2020: Data Science from the Bottom Up

Monday, May 18, 2020 \| 4-4:30pm \| [Virtual meeting](https://bluejeans.com/2916961058)

_Data Science from the Bottom Up: Computer Memory and Basic Data Structures_

How do computers store and organize information? Starting from bits and bytes, we will explore how the most basic units of data are encoded in a computer. We then will look at how computers organize random access memory. Finally we will go over some of the basic data structures used by programs to keep track of information: arrays, linked lists, and hashes.

Data Science from the Bottom Up is a series covering the basics of computer science. How do computers store information? Run calculations? Sort and filter? We start from the silicon and move our way up. Understanding the basics can help you understand better why some code run quickly and some code is slow.

## Apr 2020: Help & Networking Social

Monday, Apr 27, 2020 \| 4-5pm \| [Virtual meeting](https://bluejeans.com/2916961058)

Can't get that graph to look right? Frustrated with data cleaning? Want to squash bugs in your code and help others do the same? Bring your code/data OR come to network and help others at this informal session!

## Mar 2020: Viral Community Metagenomics

Monday, Mar 23, 2020 \| 4-5pm \| [Virtual meeting](https://bluejeans.com/795381768)

_Introduction to Viral Community Metagenomics_

In this presentation, we will go over the steps required to analyze community composition using metagenomics. Topics covered will include read quality control, assembly, binning, and classification. While this talk is framed around analyzing viral communities, the principles also apply to the study of other populations, including bacteria.

## Feb 2020: Snakemake

Monday, Feb 24, 2020 \| 4-5pm \| THSL 2901

_Intro to Snakemake_

Join us as we learn about snakemake – a workflow management system used to create reproducible and scalable data analyses. We will cover an overview of the snakemake utility and the basics of the framework, create a simple example, and touch on a few key features that make snakemake an excellent choice for building workflows.
