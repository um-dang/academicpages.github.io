The Data Analysis Networking Group (DANG!) is a forum for post-docs, grad students, and other researchers at
the University of Michigan to discuss how to analyze, present, and visualize their data.
Monthly meetings cover requested topics or specific problems & solutions that we have encountered.
Don't know how to visualize your results? Come to DANG!, and hopefully as a group we can come up with a method.
Did you recently discover an amazing R package or script? Come to DANG!, and share with us how you accomplished that.
Our hope is that these meetings & discussions will foster new ideas within our respective fields.

Check out our past and upcoming events [here](events).
