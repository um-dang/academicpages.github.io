The premise behind _DANG!_ is that we can help each other learn to be better data analysts, programmers, and scientists.
This requires trust on everyone's part.
If a facilitator or participant breaks this trust, the goals of _DANG!_ will be significantly hindered.
All participants and facilitators are required to agree with the following code of conduct.
The _DANG!_ Team will enforce this code at all meetings (in person or virtual), on our email listserv, in our Slack workspace, and any other environments we facilitate.
We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a great experience for everyone.

## The Quick Version

_DANG!_ is dedicated to providing a safe, welcoming, and harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of coding proficiency, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.
We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.
Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meeting, email listserv, and/or Slack workspace at the discretion of the _DANG!_ Team.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop their behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the _DANG!_ Team may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from that and any future sessions.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, feel unsafe or unwelcome, or have any other concerns, please contact the [_DANG!_ Team](mailto:umich.dang-requests@umich.edu) as soon as possible.
