We have a new _DANG! mini!_ created by our own Ford Hannum,

In this video, Ford walks through an introduction to using Seurat for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data. Link to the vignette: https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html. Following videos will use the Seurat object created in this video for downstream analysis.

You can check out our other _DANG! minis!_

Special thanks to [Jahn Davis](https://soundcloud.com/jahn-davis) for creating
the intro & outro music for our videos!

We need your help! If there is a tutorial you would be interested in viewing or
producing, [let us know](mailto:umich.dang-requests@umich.edu)!
We are always looking for volunteers who would like to create new _DANG! minis!_
