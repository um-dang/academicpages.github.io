## Why learn to code?

- Exploratory data analysis
- Analyze & visualize data.
- Create automated reports.
- Automate everything.
- Make your work reproducible.
- Make publication-quality figures

## What language to learn?

If there's a single popular language that everyone else in your lab, department, or field uses, just start with that one.
Why? You will want to be able to learn from others and ask for help when you need it.
For scientific research, both R and Python are popular languages and great for getting started quickly with data analysis.
R and Python are open source, so they are free as in _libre_ and free as in _free food at the department seminar_! So you don't need to buy a license to use them and will have access after you leave the university.

People in the _DANG!_ community use R, Python, and/or other languages, but R seems to be the most common.
So if you're not sure which one to pick and you'd like to get help from the _DANG!_ community, try R.
We also particularly like R for a package called R Markdown for making PDF files for analysis reports and manuscripts to share with others.
The logic of programming is the most important thing to learn, so deciding to pick up another language once you have experience in one should be easier. And it's definitely not an "either/or" scenario; as of this writing Kelly regularly uses both R and Python, and occasionally C++.

## How to learn it?

- [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is a good place to start for their free beginner [R](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r) and [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) lessons in an interactive format.
- Zena and her sister Maya created [a guide to teaching yourself R](https://github.com/zenalapp/teach-yourself-r/wiki). It takes you through the Code Academy lesson and also has extra exercises to practice data analysis.
- [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) is an organization that holds workshops to teach introductory programming skills to researchers. [U-M has a Carpentries chapter](https://umswc.github.io/) that holds workshops regularly throughout the year (with the exception of during pandemics). We highly recommend attending an in-person workshop if you get the opportunity, but you can also access the lesson materials for [R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) and [Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) online. The Carpentries has also translated [their R lesson to Spanish](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder-es/).
- As part of [Girls Who Code at U-M](http://umich.edu/~girlswc/), Zena and Kelly have contributed to a curriculum teaching Python for Data Science aimed at high school students. You can find instructions for getting started [here](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB/GWC-DCMB/blob/master/get-started.md).

If you've exhausted these options, here's an [overwhelming link of links](https://sovacool.dev/posts/2019/05/bioinf-resources) to even more resources and tools you might like to learn.

## How to use it in the real world?

If you want to automate tasks, run your code on supercomputers, or other cool stuff,
you should definitely learn the Unix Shell. The Carpentries has a [lesson the Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

The Carpentries has instructions for installing all of these tools:
- [Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/setup/)
- [R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/setup.html)
- [Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html)

## How to get help?

1. Google is your best friend. No, really. We Google questions every day!
1. Join the [_DANG!_ Slack workspace]((https://join.slack.com/t/umich-dang/shared_invite/enQtNjEzMTU5MDU3MDU2LTdhNGZjMzJmNDc0NTFkZDVkMjBmMjFhM2ZjN2QzMGY2ZDcwMTU4ZTcwOTdjZTJmMGI3MTExMGIxOTljMjllMzA)) and use the `#analysis_questions` channel. _DANG!_ exists because we think it's important to have a community of practice so you can learn from other people and get personalized help when you need it.
